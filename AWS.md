### Traditional Approach (Before Cloud)
Before cloud computing, if we wanted to deploy an application. We had to purchase physical servers, similar to how we buy laptops. These servers had high configuration (CPU, RAM, storage, networking).
We were responsible for:
    * Setting up networking
    * Managing hardware
    * Maintaining infrastructure
    * Handling security and backups

Even if we bought a powerful server. Usually, we could deploy only one application on it.
  * Most of the server resources remained unused.
  * It was not cost-effective.
  * Scaling required buying more physical servers.
  * Everything had to be managed manually.
